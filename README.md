# Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Preprocessing Project

## Project Overview
Unlock valuable insights from your data through this end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and preprocessing project. This repository provides robust tools and scripts for visualizing, cleaning, and understanding your dataset before applying machine learning models.

## Features
- **üìä Robust Data Visualizations**: Generate clear and insightful plots, including histograms, time series, and heatmaps.
- **üîç Comprehensive Statistical Summaries**: Understand the key statistics of your data at a glance.
- **üßπ Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values using customizable methods (imputation, elimination).
- **üìà Time Series Analysis**: Explore trends and seasonality to uncover patterns over time.
- **ü§ù Data Merging**: Combine multiple data sources seamlessly for enriched analysis.

## Installation
To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Saket22-CS/Saket-Infosys-Nov24.git
   cd Saket-Infosys-Nov24
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed, then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Required Libraries**:
   - `pandas`
   - `matplotlib`
   - `seaborn`
   - `numpy`

## Usage
1. **Place your data files** in the `data/` directory.
2. **Run the main analysis script**:
   ```bash
   python main_analysis.py
   ```
3. **View the generated visualizations** and statistics in the output directory or within your Python environment.

## Data Requirements
- **File Formats**: Excel files (`.xlsx` format).
- **Columns Needed**:
   - `Day Index` for time series merging.
   - `Quantity`, `Clicks`, `Impressions` for visualization and correlation analysis.

## Visuals
This project generates:
- **Histograms** for distribution analysis of independent variables.
- **Time Series Plots** to identify trends and seasonality.
- **Correlation Heatmaps** to reveal relationships between features.
